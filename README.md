# The Road Taken; From Framework to .NET 8

## Presentation summary
Do you have a .NET Framework project out there thatâ€™s really looking to be updated to dotnet? Have a look at the path we chose when upgrading a production webshop running on WebForms with every imaginable anti pattern, into a modern framework with a MVC public site and a Blazor administration interface. On this trip we will go through subjects like analysis, planning, architecture, some best practices and what will you need to do to move it from on premise or Infrastructure As A Service to a fully managed Platform hosted solution.

## The demo
The demo is a very simple example of a WebForms application, that we will upgrade to a modern .NET 8 application. We will go through the steps of upgrading the project from WebForms, into MVC5, and finally to ASP.NET on .NET8.
From here, the application will be packaged with Docker and prepared to be deployed to an Azure App Service.
